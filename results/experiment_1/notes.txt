This is where I'm putting all the results for my first big experiment that I want to include in my write-up / presentation

This one shows how Dfollow is robust to increasing the complexity of the system in terms of pois, leaders, and followers. Shows scale

Notes for now:
Trials 415 to 462 are 3 stat runs for G and Df
100 gens for 1,5,10,15,20,25
50 gens for 50,100

Running more experiments on graf 15 to round this out with D
and more gens for bigger numbers
